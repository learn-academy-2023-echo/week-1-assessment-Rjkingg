# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?
 
Your answer: Git is an open-source, version control system that was created so that developers could easily share and edit code. Github on the otherhand, is a platform hosted on the web that allows developers to showcase their work and collaborate with others.

Researched answer:
Git, created by Linus Torvalds, is a control system that is open-sourced, free and allows developers to share code to the same code base. Github is a web-based hosting service that holds git repositories. You cannot use Github without Git.
2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The Javascript operators that will return a Boolean value are the ==(loosely equal)===(Strictly equal) operators

Researched answer: 
The logical and &&       or||      not "bang"! operator. Comparison and logical operators will return a Boolean value
3. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An arrays index starts at the first element and is zero'd. An arrays value counts all of the elements within the array, from 1.

Researched answer: Every value in an array has a location, known as the index. Indexs are sequential and start with zero and go up by one. An arrays value is the content within each element-for example: Var bestRappersAlive = ["Nas", "J Cole", "Kendrick"] "Nas", "J Cole", "Kendrick", are all values in this array and "Nas" is at 0 index, 1, 2, "J Cole" and "Kendrick" respectively. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: An Array can hold a string but a string cannot contain an array. Arrays and Strings both hold information for a declared variable. An array holds different data types, while strings do not.

Researched answer: An array is a data structure, while a string is an object. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: A proper pair programming technique would be the driver/navigator technique. It involves two people, who are either assigned the role of a navigator or driver. The navigator does not have their fingers on the keyboard, they are verbally instructing the driver on what to code. The driver has hands on the keyboard and accepts instruction from the navigator until it is time to switch roles.

Researched answer: 
Driver, navigator method with a proper technique would look like the navigator being observant, checking for any inaccuracies and focusing on the bigger picture, while the driver is actively writing code.
## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A function that returns a function or takes other functions as arguments.

2. Jest: A Javascript Testing Framework that ensures correctness of any JS codebase. You can write tests that will quickly give you results.

3. Objects: An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality.

4. Method: A shorter syntax for defining a function property in an object initializer; it can also be used in classes.

5. Classes: A template for creating objects. A class can be defined in two ways: A class expression or a class declaration
